### **Featured Dish: Herb-Crusted Salmon with Lemon Butter Sauce**

#### **Ingredients**:

##### **For the Salmon**:
- 4 salmon fillets (6 oz each)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill
- Zest of 1 lemon
- Salt and pepper to taste

##### **For the Lemon Butter Sauce**:
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- Salt and pepper to taste

#### **Instructions**:

1. **Prepare the Salmon**:
   - Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it.
   - In a small bowl, mix together the panko breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, dill, and lemon zest. Set aside.
   - Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels. Season each fillet with salt and pepper.
   - Brush the top of each salmon fillet with a thin layer of Dijon mustard.
   - Press the breadcrumb mixture onto the mustard-coated side of the salmon fillets, ensuring an even layer.

2. **Bake the Salmon**:
   - Place the salmon fillets on the prepared baking sheet.
   - Drizzle olive oil over the breadcrumb crust.
   - Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and the crust is golden brown.

3. **Prepare the Lemon Butter Sauce**:
   - While the salmon is baking, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.
   - Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute, until fragrant.
   - Stir in the lemon juice and heavy cream.
   - Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste.

4. **Serve**:
   - Remove the salmon from the oven and let it rest for a minute.
   - Spoon the lemon butter sauce over the salmon fillets.
   - Serve the herb-crusted salmon with your choice of side dishes, such as roasted vegetables or a fresh salad.
